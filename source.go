// Where the data comes from.
//
// This interface is the whole reusability story. Every table this library
// reads is asked for through it, so a caller can supply their own, load from a
// directory instead of the binary, or carry only the locales they need. The
// package it replaces welded its tables in with go:embed at package scope,
// which is why importing it cost fourteen megabytes whether or not anything
// was formatted.
//
// A Source hands back bytes, not decoded values. Decoding is the model
// layer's business, and keeping it out of here means a source can be a
// directory, an archive or a network cache without knowing what any of it
// means.

// A Marker names one data set.
